## Models and modules

These are the neural networks and layers definitions.
Layers that do not exist standalone are in `layers` folder.
There are 2 types of standalone networks: modules and models
(or chains, which stack modules).

See `uresnet.py` for an example of module.

See `uresnet_ppn_chain.py` for an example of chain.
